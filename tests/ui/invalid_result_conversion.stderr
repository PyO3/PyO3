   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `Result<(), MyError>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `&Result<(), MyError>: IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>`
           which is required by `&Result<(), MyError>: IntoPyResult<Result<&Result<(), MyError>, PyErr>>`
           `&mut Result<(), MyError>: IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>`
           which is required by `&mut Result<(), MyError>: IntoPyResult<Result<&mut Result<(), MyError>, PyErr>>`
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `pyfunction` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
