error[E0599]: the method `into_py_kind` exists for reference `&Blah`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `Blah: IntoPyObject<'_, PyAny>`
          which is required by `Blah: IntoPyObjectKind`
          `Blah: IntoPy<Py<PyAny>>`

          `&Blah: IntoPyObject<'_, PyAny>`
          which is required by `&Blah: IntoPyObjectKind`
note: the traits `IntoPy` and `IntoPyObject` must be implemented

  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following traits define an item `into_py_kind`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
          candidate #1: `IntoPyKind`
          candidate #2: `IntoPyObjectKind`
