  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>` is not implemented for `Blah`

  = help: the following other types implement trait `IntoPy<T>`:
            <bool as IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>>
            <char as IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>>
            <isize as IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>>

            <i64 as IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>>
            <i128 as IntoPy<PyDetached<PyAny>>>
          and $N others
  = note: required for `Blah` to implement `OkWrap<Blah>`
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `pyo3::pyfunction` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
