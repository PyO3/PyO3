  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following traits define an item `conversion_kind`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
          candidate #1: `IntoPyKind`
          candidate #2: `IntoPyNoneKind`
          candidate #3: `IntoPyObjectKind`
