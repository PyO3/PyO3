* Added bindings for `PyList_GetItemRef` on Python 3.13 and newer. Also added
  `ffi::compat::PyList_GetItemRef` which re-exports the FFI binding on Python
  3.13 and newer and defines a compatibility shim on older versions. This
  function returns an owned reference to the item in the list and should be
  preferred if the list is not known *a priori* to be shared between threads.
